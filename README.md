# Advanced-Statistics-Machine-Learning
from DSTI Course of Pr. Christine Mallot - S21

This course focuses on two main areas: the CART algorithm and random forests in the context of Big Data and being used for a Map/Reduce system (first week), feature selection and engineering, covering techniques such as bagging, boosting, cross-validation and concluding with model competition and selection and an overview ofvarious faulty implementations of techniques in “point-and-click” tools.

Topics to be covered are:
1. The CART algorithm
2. Random Forest (RF)
3. CART & RF for Map/Reduce: the mathematical challenges
4. Feature selection using CART & RF
5. Feature engineering using CART & RF
6. Models competition and selection

The Assessment was based on making a report using the tools obtained from the course
